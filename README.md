# dotfiles

My dotfiles, how unique and original

Meant to be run when I create a new user, and to sync dotfiles and binaries across machines/users

### installation

`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ozh/dotfiles/master/remote.sh | sh` will
* clone/update this repo
* execute the local install
